# MBTI Quality Assurance Framework

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive quality assurance framework for the MBTI personality test implementation to ensure high accuracy, theoretical compliance, and reliable results.

## Quality Dimensions

### 1. Question Quality & Bias Elimination

**Objectives:**
- Eliminate language bias favoring one option over another
- Ensure clear, unambiguous wording
- Balance question distribution across function types
- Validate theoretical accuracy of question design

**Validation Methods:**
- Automated bias detection scanning for loaded words
- Language clarity analysis (length, complexity)
- Distribution analysis across cognitive functions
- Expert review against MBTI theory

**Quality Metrics:**
- Zero bias indicators in question language
- Balanced distribution (8 questions per function type)
- Clear, concise wording (under 80 characters per option)
- Theoretical alignment with function definitions

### 2. Calculation Accuracy & Theoretical Compliance

**Objectives:**
- Ensure calculation logic follows MBTI theory precisely
- Validate function stack construction rules
- Verify attitude alternation in cognitive stacks
- Test edge case handling

**Validation Methods:**
- Theoretical compliance checks against Jung/Myers-Briggs theory
- Function stack validation (attitude alternation, uniqueness)
- Response pattern simulation for all 16 types
- Consistency testing across multiple iterations

**Quality Metrics:**
- 100% compliance with MBTI theoretical rules
- Correct function stack construction for all types

- Noise injection to test robustness
- Confidence threshold validation
- Edge case scenario testing

**Quality Metrics:**
- Distinct response patterns for each type
- 85%+ accuracy with realistic noise levels
- Appropriate confidence scoring (70-95% range)
- Graceful handling of incomplete/ambiguous data

### 4. Statistical Reliability

**Objectives:**
- Ensure consistent results across multiple attempts
- Validate statistical significance of differences
- Test temporal stability of results
- Measure inter-question correlation appropriately

**Validation Methods:**
- Multi-iteration consistency testing
- Statistical analysis of result distributions
- Correlation analysis between questions and outcomes
- Temporal stability assessment

**Quality Metrics:**
- 80%+ consistency across 5 iterations for same input
- Normal distribution of confidence scores
- Appropriate inter-question correlations
- Stable results over time for same responses

## Testing Protocols

### Automated Testing Suite
