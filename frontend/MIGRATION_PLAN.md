## Key Changes Implemented

### Technology Stack Migration
- **React** â†’ **SolidJS** - Better performance, smaller bundle size
- **Material-UI** â†’ **SUID** - SolidJS-native Material Design components
- **Vite** â†’ **RSBuild** - Faster build times and better optimization
- **Yarn** â†’ **Bun** - Faster package management and runtime
- **React Router** â†’ **SolidJS Router** - Native SolidJS routing

### Build System Migration
```bash
# Previous React setup
yarn install
yarn dev          # Vite development server
yarn build        # Vite production build

# New SolidJS setup
bun install
bun run dev       # RSBuild development server
bun run build     # RSBuild production build
```

## Build Commands - Current Production Setup

### Development
```bash
# SolidJS development (primary)
bun run dev          # Port 3000 with RSBuild

# Backend development
bun run dev:backend  # Port 8080
```

### Production Build
```bash
# Frontend build
bun run build        # RSBuild production build

# Backend build  
bun run build:backend # CDK Lambda build
```

### Full-stack Development
```bash
# Start both frontend and backend
bun run dev          # From root directory
```

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Fix TypeScript Issues**: Resolve React/SolidJS type conflicts
2. **Complete Basic App**: Get `App.solid.tsx` working without errors
3. **Migrate PersonalApplications**: Convert first major component
4. **Test Basic Functionality**: Ensure navigation and basic features work
